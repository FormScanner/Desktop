FormScanner
===

FormScanner is an OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) software that automatically marks multiple-choice papers. 
FormScanner doesn't not bind you to use a default template of the form, but gives you the ability to use a custom template created from a simple scan of a blank form.
The modules can be scanned as images with a simple scanner and processed with FormScanner software.
All the collected information can be easily exported to a spreadsheet.
